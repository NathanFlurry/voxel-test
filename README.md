## Discussion

This project was intended purely as a way to get familiar with Glium.

Note that the performance is dismal, primarily since the terrain generation all operates on a single thread. It was initially designed this way in order to be compatible with WASM.

Feel free to fork this project and make changes of your own!

## Running

* Make sure Rust is installed
* Execute `cargo run --release`
* Enjoy!
